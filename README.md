# decentralized social network system -- a revolution

## it has a special meaning for China. the ultimate GOAL of this project behind decentralization is trying to achieve the freedom of network in the mechanism of "helping others helps yourself",so that people without techincal background can freely get access to information outside the wall. 
### technology is only part of human civilization,there are many people have done their contribution to this field, but there are many more other civilization should flow freely into Chiina, a freedom network is critical to carry the human civilization to any corner of the world, I was raised up in side a network wall with censorship,and used to be a typical nationalist,I know exactly how a freedom network can change a people, not just techincal skills but many other that are more valuable in one's life. 

### My personal experience and observation tells me that I should agree with Elon Musk's view on AI thread. but Mars is over a hunder miles away,democracy is just outside my door!
### AI is a threat to us when it is in the evil men's hands, for instance centralized social comunication system that use AI to spy or sensors users' messages or articles.
### I agree with a lot of people's opinion that decentralization is an effective way to defense ourselves from the AI's threat. 
### I believe I am not the first person who have realized that we should build a decentralized social networking software system in the near future, which is a point to point comunication system without some company's centralized datacenter, which is more democratic , which means we the users have more options to choose the software APP providers, this social netwroking APPs are compatible to each other, because they are using the same standard protocol
### I am looking for people who have the same opinions out there.

# why user would like it as I do
1. anyone in C-country can get access to any good website like Gxxgle and yxxtube without any technical background.
2. it is impossible to block a user,it can reach to anyone in any place,it is more secure.

3. more and more people have VPS for various purposes. a lot of those people are deep learning / AI guys,they know best what AI can do. like I mention before, owning a VPS of your own will be a trend,imagine 20 years ago not every one has a laptop, now more and more people has many computers. it will be very convenient for one to have a VPS on the cloud for multiple purposes .

4. free meal VS privacy. indeed most user will have to pay for extra money for the VPS. but with the developing of technologies like docker, the price will going down and will finally become ignorable. for most people privacy is worth the very little amount of money. 

5. will those who don't want a VPS be abandoned ? no ! because we use standard protocol, there are a lot of companies who are willing to support these users who don't want to pay for extra money to buy a VPS, for them users means money ! but those users still have the options to migrate their datas to his own VPS once they decide to buy their own VPS.

6. is it difficult for a user to get start? no ! because the whole system has been standardised,and been divided into several parts, these can provide many opportunities for start-up companies to provide such services, so that it will be very easy for the user to use,just like today’s social networking APP.
more providers and more competition,user has more options,evil companies use AI to probe users’ privacy and restrict user’s freedom of speech will be abandoned by the user.

7. it is your own self-media platform. if you got skills, you can attract more views on your platform,which brings extra business opportunities to you.

### 这个想法的初衷是以前总是幻想着一种去机房中心化的硬件网络机制，既：所有的手机或者电脑终端能够自组网。

### 后来想或许可以在这中心化的硬件网络平台上打通千千万万个互相联通的隧道，理论上也是实现了一种虚拟的去中心化的网络。
### 我是个外行人，在内行人看来这可能是个很naive的想法，但我相信再天真的想法，万一行动起来证明可行呢，那将是整个社交媒体网络生态的一种革新。这样的话，每个小公司都有机会来参与进入这个生态，而不是只有几个巨头可以玩。
# 这个生态就会更加民主
